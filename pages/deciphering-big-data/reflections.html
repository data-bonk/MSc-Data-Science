									<h3>Final Module Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										This reflection outlines my personal and academic development during the "Deciphering Big Data" module, with a particular focus on the group project (Unit 6) and the final Executive Summary (Unit 11). It considers the knowledge and technical skills I have gained, the challenges I encountered, and how these experiences have shaped my thinking and performance. I will also relate my journey to the module learning outcomes and critically evaluate my contributions.
									</p>
									<p>
										The early weeks of the module (Units 1–3) introduced foundational concepts of big data, data management, and various data types and formats. This stage provided a vital context for understanding structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, as outlined in the module learning outcomes. Reading Chapters 3 and 6 of McKinney’s work helped me visualise how data formats such as CSV, JSON, and XML are parsed and manipulated using Python’s pandas library (McKinney, 2022). Initially, setting up the e-portfolio felt overwhelming due to my unfamiliarity with web design tools. However, by choosing a simplified template (Forty) and leveraging the knowledge gained in Unit 3 about HTML and APIs, I was able to grow in confidence.
									</p>
									<p>
										My understanding of data collection methods deepened in Units 3 and 4. The web scraping activity and UNICEF data cleaning tasks allowed me to explore practical data wrangling methods. These exercises provided me with hands-on experience in preparing data for analysis, including removing null values, formatting inconsistent entries, and enhancing human readability. Through this, I began to understand the importance of data reliability, integrity, and pre-processing skills, which are directly aligned with the module's learning outcomes on evaluating data readiness and longevity.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Units 5 to 7 transitioned from cleaning to modelling. Unit 6 was pivotal, as it involved submitting the initial group design proposal. Working in a team with Amaka and David was a rewarding but sometimes challenging experience. From the outset, we agreed to assign roles based on individual strengths and abilities. This proved effective, and our regular meetings ensured consistent collaboration. Emotionally, I was initially apprehensive about group work, especially with unfamiliar peers. However, I found that our collective commitment and early establishment of ground rules helped foster a cooperative environment. We each critiqued one another’s work constructively, which not only improved the final product but also enhanced my communication and teamworking skills, essential in any data-driven professional setting..
									</p>
									<p>
										That said, the 1000-word limit on the design proposal posed a real challenge. While we presented a solid schema using the Kaggle logistics dataset, feedback indicated that our critical analysis, particularly in terms of tool and technology selection, was lacking. In retrospect, this confirmed that technical work without justification is incomplete. I used this feedback as a learning point for my Unit 11 Executive Summary, where I explored PostgreSQL versus NoSQL in greater depth, comparing them across performance, reliability, and scalability (Stonebraker & Hellerstein, 2005).
									</p>
									<p>
										Unit 7’s focus on normalisation was a turning point. Initially, I misunderstood the requirements and skipped explaining each stage of normalisation. Upon revisiting this, I learned how vital 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF are in eliminating redundancy and ensuring data consistency. The process of refining the database schema using these principles played a significant role in my Unit 11 work. For example, in my final design, I replaced free-text fields, such as "brake_condition", with lookup tables. I added CHECK constraints for values like sensor percentages, which enhanced query accuracy and integrity (Elmasri & Navathe, 2016).
									</p>
									<p>
										Compliance and ethical data handling (Unit 8) also resonated strongly with me. Understanding GDPR, ISO 27001, and other legal frameworks broadened my perspective on the responsibility involved in data collection and management. I demonstrated this understanding by incorporating GDPR principles into my final Executive Summary, highlighting how the database design avoided storing personal data and adhered to storage limitation policies (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). These elements were positively mentioned in my feedback and are transferable to any data-handling role, particularly those in healthcare or logistics where compliance is paramount.
									</p>
									<p>
										In Units 9 and 10, we explored DBMS models and APIs. I found the SQLite workshop particularly useful because it built directly on our earlier work with survey data, showing how cleaned human-readable data could be transformed into structured SQL tables. I developed a deeper understanding of ACID compliance, and later applied this to my Executive Summary, discussing how PostgreSQL supports atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability in transactional environments (PostgreSQL Global Development Group, 2024). Writing a security requirements specification in Unit 10 was also a valuable exercise that strengthened my critical analysis of systems design.
									</p>
									<p>
										Unit 11 marked a clear evolution in both technical sophistication and written clarity. Drawing on earlier feedback, I ensured that the Executive Summary was rich in rationale, particularly in areas where I had previously underdeveloped them, such as tool selection, referential integrity, indexing, and compliance. My description of the revised schema highlighted the lessons I had learned about iterative design, particularly with timestamping for temporal queries, enforcing foreign key constraints, and tracking the data lifecycle. These reflections demonstrate not only technical growth but also a shift in mindset: from simply building systems to understanding and justifying every design decision with clarity and precision.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, Unit 12’s look into predictive analytics and machine learning sparked my curiosity about the future of big data. Discovering how algorithms are being applied in medical robotics and drug discovery was particularly inspiring. It reminded me that data science is an evolving field where the tools and theories I’ve learned here are just the beginning.
									</p>
									<p>
										In summary, this module has allowed me to develop robust technical competencies in data collection, cleaning, modelling, and storage. It has also strengthened my soft skills, including communication, teamwork, and reflective analysis. Most importantly, it taught me the value of combining technical execution with critical evaluation. In the future, I feel confident in applying these skills in real-world settings, whether in database design, data ethics, or analytics.
